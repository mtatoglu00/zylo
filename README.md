# Zylo - Hydraulic Cylinder Design System

A modular engineering platform that streamlines the hydraulic cylinder design workflow from customer specifications to final CAD-ready designs

## üéØ Project Vision

Zylo transforms the traditional hydraulic cylinder design process by providing a component-based system where engineers can:
- Configure cylinder designs using modular building blocks
- Apply multiple industry standards (ISO, ASME, EN, DIN) with automatic compliance checking
- Generate automated technical documentation and compliance reports
- Export CAD-ready dimensions and analysis data

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Component-Based Design
- **Modular Components**: End caps, pistons, rods, tubes, seals as independent, configurable modules
- **Factory Pattern**: Dynamic component instantiation with extensible type system
- **Strategy Pattern**: Pluggable calculation engines for different industry standards

### Core Workflow
1. **Input**: Customer specifications (pressure, stroke, force, environment)
2. **Preliminary Design**: Automated component selection and basic sizing
3. **Documentation**: Auto-generated reports and technical drawings

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Django with REST API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with material properties and component catalogs
- **Frontend**: React/Vue.js with dynamic component configuration
- **Documentation**: MkDocs


### Documentation Automation
- Customer-specific report templates
- Compliance tracking and certification
- Technical drawing generation
